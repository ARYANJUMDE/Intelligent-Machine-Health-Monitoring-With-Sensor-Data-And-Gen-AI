# Intelligent-Machine-Health-Monitoring-With-Sensor-Data-And-Gen-AI

✨ Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered predictive maintenance system that monitors the health of industrial machines using real-time sensor data. It detects anomalies and predicts potential failures to reduce downtime ,maintenance costs and increases safety of workers.





🔑 Key Features

✅ Real-time monitoring of industrial machines using sensor data

✅ Predictive analytics for potential machine failures

✅ User-friendly Streamlit web interface for data upload & prediction download

✅ Generates actionable insights to optimize maintenance schedules





🛠 Technology Stack

Programming Language: Python 3.x

Libraries & Tools: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, joblib, Streamlit

Machine Learning Model: Random Forest Classifier

Deployment: Streamlit Cloud (Web App)





⚡ How It Works

Collect sensor data (temperature, vibration, pressure, etc.) in CSV format.

Preprocess the data for the ML model.

Predict machine health status or time-to-failure.

Streamlit app allows users to upload CSV files and download predictions.





🎯 Benefits / Impact

Reduces machine downtime and maintenance costs

Optimizes maintenance schedules

Enables proactive decision-making with AI insights

Increases saftey of workers at workplace.
